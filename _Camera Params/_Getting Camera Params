First, prepare a chessboard in front of the camera. Must be lit, 9x6

Use captureimage.py to generate a calibration image file. Make sure to select the correct camera in code, and Press Q to capture image

Then, run cameraCalibration.py and dance the chessboard in front of the camera. Make sure to select the correct camera in code, collect about 20 samples

After that, use reprojectionError.py to verify the undistort looks good on the calibration image file.

Finally, copy the last entry in each of the four csv file into bestParams.py for record purposes.

These params for each camera will be input into the camera-params.json for the main project
